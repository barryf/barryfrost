# barryfrost

This is my personal website, hosted at [barryfrost.com](https://barryfrost.com/).

It's built using the [Architect](https://arc.codes/) serverless framework in Node.js and must be deployed to AWS.

It uses Vibrancy for its headless CMS backend. See the separate [vibrancy](https://github.com/barryf/vibrancy) project for more information.

## Status

This project is currently under active development and should be considered highly experimental and likely to change at any time. You're free to fork and hack on it but its primary purpose is to evolve based on my needs. Use at your own risk!

## Licence

The source code is available under the MIT licence, but you may not copy my siteâ€™s design or content. SVG icons are sourced from [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com).
